                    <p class="mt-20">As a testament to the agency’s continued commitment and reaffirmed efforts to mainstream Gender and Women Empowerment in the discourse of migration and development, the Commission on Filipinos Overseas (CFO) headed by CFO Secretary Romulo V. Arugay undertook month-long activities and services for its women clients and employees to celebrate International Women’s Month.<br><br>

                    The CFO’s Gender and Development Focal Point System-Technical Working Group (GFPS-TWG) led the preparation of several initiatives  to honor the women officers and clients of the Commission. The activities were planned and implemented to engage various stakeholders in advocating women’s empowerment and cultivating their more significant societal place.</p>

                    <p class="mt-20">Before March, the Commission arranged a 2-part training focused on mainstreaming gender and development concepts in the workplace. The first training was implemented on 9 February 2023 and centered on current laws and policies ensuring women’s safety and welfare. Entitled “Training on the Safe Spaces Act and Other Laws,” Atty. Claire De Leon, a lawyer for the Commission on Human Rights (CHR) and an expert on gender studies, led the discussion.<br><br>

                    Among the laws introduced to the CFO officers are the Anti-VAWC (Violence Against Women and Children) Law, the Anti-Sexual Harassment Law of 1995, the Safe Spaces Act, and the difference between the Anti-Sexual Harassment Law of 1995 and the Safe Spaces Act.<br><br>
                    
                    Atty. De Leon also discussed the concepts of consent, power dynamics, intersectionality, and the basics of SOGIE (Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity Expression Equality). She also presented the technicalities of responding to and dealing with sexual harassment in the workplace.</p>

                    <p class="mt-20">An in-depth training in gender sensitivity and creating an LGBTQIA+-friendly workspace was conducted on 13 March 2023. This second training was part of a series of capacity building for the CFO officers to equip them with a continuous and updated appreciation of the intricacies of gender and development within the institution. In her opening remarks, Undersecretary Valery Joy A. Brion was optimistic that the training could help foster an inclusive and non-discriminatory environment where everyone, especially women and members of the LGBTQIA+ community, can thrive and feel safe. She also expressed her confidence that the Commission will continue in its strong advocacy towards promoting, recognizing, and understanding the significant contribution of LGBTQIA+ to their communities.<br><br>

                    Mr. Glenn Russel “Russ” Alejon of UP Babaylan conducted the training. He shared the experiences and challenges of the queer community, such as the degree of discrimination they have been receiving more than heterosexuals do. The concepts of transitions, misgendering, and deadnaming were also thoroughly discussed. He also facilitated group activities that explored different characteristics of the participants. The CFO officers were of the same view and realized that the activities helped them understand and appreciate how different situations in life not only differentiate experiences but also unite everyone.<br><br>

                    Mr. Alejon was hopeful that through the training, the CFO employees now have a better understanding of the struggles of the Queer community and would practice their newfound knowledge to help make the workplace a safe and thriving environment for all.</p>

                    <p class="mt-20">For the month-long celebration, employees wore purple advocacy polo shirts every Wednesday that bore the logo for this year’s Women’s Month Celebration. This reflected the Commission’s solidarity towards attaining women’s empowerment and gender equality.<br><br>

                    Recognized and celebrated as International Women’s Day (IWD), the Commission celebrated March 8 with several activities for women employees and clients to make the day more significant and spark the discussion on women’s contributions to society. Both the Manila and Cebu offices were decorated in purple, and a photo booth was available for clients and employees. The clients enjoyed the photo booth and were gifted with printouts of their photos that they could take home to commemorate the special event. Female employees were given free lunches and roses to celebrate IWD 2023.</p>

                    Secretary Arugay spearheaded the 2023 NWM celebration in the CFO-Cebu office and met the CFO officers and clientele in the Visayas Region. Before starting the Pre-Departure Orientation Seminar (PDOS) session for migrants bound for New Zealand, Sec. Arugay pledged the Commission’s continued efforts to protect the rights and defend the well-being of migrants, especially women. He encouraged them to demonstrate the great values of Filipinos wherever they may go. Further, he also thanked the staff of CFO Cebu for their valuable efforts in providing empowering services to kababayan in the Visayas region.</p>

                    <p>The Commission also showcased the talents of its employees for clients through “Harana kay Juana.” This initiative started in 2019 that taps the Commission’s homegrown talents by serenading the clients every March as part of the celebration of March as NWM. Clients can request their favorite songs to be played, and the homegrown talents gladly oblige these requests.<br><br>

                    Another initiative spearheaded by interns of the Commission is an audio Visual Presentation (AVP) dedicated to the female employees of the Commission. The video featured snippets of interviews of women in CFO who wear different hats–as public servants, mothers, children, and colleagues. This AVP serves as a reminder that women are achievers, nurturers, and societal pillars.</p>

                    <p>This year, the GFPS also held a letter-writing contest for the employees. Dubbed “Dear Juana,” employees submitted letters expressing their appreciation and admiration for the strength, courage, and service of mothers, daughters, employees, and key figures who played a crucial role in transforming their lives. Three entries won, which were chosen by the Secretary, Undersecretary, and Head Executive Assistant. The winners are as follows:<br>
                    <br>1) Ms. Celine Del Monte’s entry featured herself, wherein she thanked herself for loving unconditionally and being an awesome solo parent;
                    <br>2) Ms. Shareefa Gadjali’s entry featured her best friend and how she admires her strength without scraping of her softness and love for life; and lastly
                    <br>3) Mr. Erwin Paul Cristobal’s entry featured his beloved mother who, despite her battle with cancer, showed strength and resiliency. All the entries were featured on the Commission’s Facebook page.</p>

                    <p>To launch the official celebrations for the 2023 National Women’s Month, members of the GFPS hosted a game for the employees entitled “Division Feud” for the Flag Ceremony last March 13, 2023. Hosted by Mr. Erwin Paul Cristobal, two male employees from the five divisions bested one another in naming possible answers to the surveys about women in the workplace. Members of the GFPS had female employees answer a survey with questions ranging from their favorite makeup brands to the different rights of women under the Magna Carta of Women. Ultimately, Mr. Kevin Ladi and Mr. Rommel Dela Cruz of the Administrative and Finance Division got the top prize.</p>

                    <p>As part of the continuing information campaign of the CFO, community education programs were conducted to raise awareness of the realities and risks of irregular migration, specifically on illegal recruitment, human trafficking, and mail-order spouse schemes.<br><br>

                    CFO conducted the 12th series of its Human, Hindi Laruan anti-trafficking webinar to address the relationship between drug trafficking and human trafficking. The resource speaker, Atty.

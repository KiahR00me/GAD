The activities were a reaffirmation of its commitment towards advancing gender equality and promoting women empowerment as it joined once again the nation in celebrating this year’s National Women’s Month celebrations.<br><br>

                    The CFO undertook a series of activities that were aimed not only to recognize the women for their significant contributions around the world, but also to educate the public on gender issues in order to address the lingering gender inequality in society.<br><br>
                    
                    The activities form part of the Commission’s commitment in implementing gender-responsive programs for Filipino emigrants, and in providing interventions and services for Filipinos overseas, especially those who are victims of human trafficking and gender-based violence. In 2019, CFO was recognized as one of gender responsive government agencies by the Philippine Commission on Women.</p>

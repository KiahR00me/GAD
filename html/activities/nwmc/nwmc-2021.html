                    A year after the COVID-19 global pandemic struck, almost everyone is still struggling, from managing pandemic response to mental health problems or deteriorating socio-economic conditions. Most of International and national events that used to be big public gatherings are now being celebrated virtually, including the 2021 National Women’s Month Celebration.<br><br>
                    
                    The Commission on Filipinos Overseas (CFO) was not deterred by the ongoing public health crisis in celebrating Women’s Month as it organized a series of online and physical activities. These activities are the Commission’s tribute to women who play a vibrant and dynamic role in our society, whether in the Philippines or abroad.</p>

                    <p class="mt-20">The CFO jointly organized with the Cavite State University a Webinar on “Men Opposed to Violence Against Women Everywhere (MOVE) last March 2, 2021. It was participated in by over 60 male personnel of the CFO.<br></br>

                    The MOVE Orientation was aimed at enlightening CFO male personnel about gender issues and the lingering gender inequality in society as well as reinforcing gender equality and deconstructing existing bias and discriminatory acts against women.</p>

                    <p class="mt-20">After the webinar, several CFO male personnel expressed their insights. Mr. Erwin Paul Cristobal believes that men should be the foremost partners in fighting violence against women and that gender parity should be the norm, not the exception. For Mr. Arnel Sual, men or husbands who do household chores shouldn’t lose face, as it means sharing of responsibilities with their female partner or wife.</p>

                    <h3 class="py-20 text-center text-2xl font-medium uppercase">4. Telecounseling and Webinar Series for Filipino Spouses or Partners of Foreign Nationals</h3>
                    <p>In recognition of the increased exposure of women migrants to various gender-related concerns brought on by the global pandemic, the CFO introduced Telecounseling for Filipino spouses or partners of foreign nationals immediately with the onset of the quarantine measures last year.<br></br>

                    Telecounseling, in which the CFO Counselors conduct a scheduled online individual counseling, is an alternative to the actual conduct of the Guidance and Counseling Program. This serves as a channel for providing marriage and fiancée migrants with adequate information and advice on the realities of intermarriage and migration, rights and obligations overseas; available support network for migrants in distress; and cultural and social realities overseas. Emigrants are also encouraged to openly express and discuss their particular concerns about migration and their cross-cultural relationships through this platform.<br></br>
                    
                    This innovation further improves the Commission’s existing services for women migrants, their children, and other youth migrants. This also reinforces the provision of welfare services to women migrants.<br></br>
                    
                    To further promote awareness on the realities of marriage migration, the CFO conducted Ang Ibayo kong Pag-Ibig, a webinar on the Issues of Filipinos in Intermarriage on 10 March 2021. Topics included the demographic profile of Filipinos in intermarriage, areas of concern on inter-racial relationships, salient features of the Republic Act 9208 as amended, or the Anti-Trafficking in Persons Act, and the Republic Act 10906 or the Anti-Mail Order Spouse Act. It was attended by around 72 participants from various local government units.<br></br>
                    
                    On 30 March 2021, the CFO implemented the first series of its Human, Hindi Laruan Anti-Trafficking Webinar Series entitled Crazy Little Tour Called Love. Resource speakers from the CFO, Department of Tourism and the Bureau of Immigration presented various issues on how tourism is being used to exploit Filipinos, especially women, and the government’s intervention to prevent possible human trafficking. The event was attended by at least 80 participants from the local government units and tourism-related organizations. The second episode of this Webinar Seminar was aired on 13 April 2021.</p>

                    The 2-hour online activity addressed the challenges faced by Filipino emigrants.

The speakers themselves experienced these concerns during their first few years of settlement in Australia. They admitted that while they are greatly affected by the pandemic, they are enjoying their lives in the Land Down Under.<br></br>
                    
                    The activity paid tribute also to women in its segment CFO React. Viewers were invited to send messages to significant women in their lives and use the hashtag #SaludoAkoSaIyoNanay, #SaludoAkoSaIyoSis, #SaludoAkoSaIyoTita, #SaludoAkoSaIyoFriend, or #SaludoAkoSaIyoLola. CFO male officers’ quotes for women were also included in the said segment.</p>

                                    <p>The first session was led by Atty. E. (Leo) D. Battad from the UP College of Law, who provided an in-depth discussion on the distinction between sex and gender, Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Expression (SOGIESC), and the LGBTQI+ spectrum. She explained the biological aspects of sex, including intersex variations, and highlighted that gender identity might not always correspond with an individual’s assigned sex at birth. Atty. Battad also discussed the complexities of oppression, particularly for those with intersectional identities, illustrating how societal norms, policies, and structures can marginalize certain groups.</p>

                            <p>In a subsequent session, Atty. Battad addressed the issue of patriarchy, describing it as a system where men dominate both the public and private spheres, leading to the oppression and subordination of women and other gender-diverse individuals. However, she clarified that while men may benefit from patriarchal privileges, they can also advocate for gender equality, and conversely, women may unknowingly support the system.</p>

Battad then discussed key gender-related legislation, including the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW), as well as relevant Philippine laws. She covered Republic Act No. 9262, known as the Anti-Violence Against Women and Their Children Act of 2004; Republic Act No. 7877, the Anti-Sexual Harassment Act of 1995; and Republic Act No. 11313, the Safe Spaces Act.

                                    <p>The fourth part of the training featured Mr. Marwin Joseph G. Catindig of Aujen’s Coffee, who conducted a barista training session. He introduced participants to the fundamentals of coffee, including different species, processing methods, roast levels, and extraction techniques. Two representatives from each Division were invited to make a latte as part of the demonstration, with the aim of empowering employees to consider starting a personal coffee business for as little as ₱35,000.00.</p>

                                    <p>The final session focused on self-defense, with Mr. Rosenberg L. Rosete from FIST Gym providing an overview of the anatomy of a self-defense situation and key self-defense techniques. Participants were taught the ABCs of self-defense—Awareness, Boundary setting, and Combat—and 20 employees volunteered to practice basic stances and techniques. The trainers also emphasized the importance of being aware of one’s surroundings and varying daily routines to avoid predictable patterns that could make one vulnerable to attackers.</p>

                    <p class="mt-20">Facilitated by the Commission’s GFPS Technical Working Group (TWG), the event was a key initiative under the implementation of the Commission’s 2024 GAD Plan and Budget (GPB). The training program not only reinforced key gender mainstreaming principles but also ingrained in CFO employees the vital importance of gender sensitivity in professional settings and across Filipino society at large. The program’s success was made possible through the guidance and oversight of the Commission’s GFPS Chairperson, Secretary Arugay, and the GFPS Executive Committee chaired by Atty. Alli, whose leadership has ensured that the CFO’s gender mainstreaming efforts are not only sustained but also integrated into every service and program of the Commission, thereby enhancing its public service delivery.</p>

                    <p class="mt-20">The CFO’s longstanding commitment to gender equality and the empowerment of women and marginalized genders is evident in the various purple advocacy shirts worn by its employees over the years, symbolizing their active support for gender mainstreaming. Since 2017, the CFO has been a staunch advocate of the PCW’s initiatives, having institutionalized its GFPS, annually celebrating National Women’s Month and International Women’s Day, and contributing to policy development in support of gender equality.</p>

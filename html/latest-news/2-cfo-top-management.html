                    “It is the very mandate of the Commission to institute protective interventions that would provide a safety buffer for our clients – particularly, Filipino permanent migrants or residents, naturalized citizens or dual citizens, spouses and other partners of foreign nationals, among others – as they move through the phases of migration.”<br><br>
                    
                    He added that the executive briefing is highly significant to the gender mainstreaming efforts of the Commission and its goal of strengthening its protective interventions to significantly decrease the vulnerability of its clients, especially women and children. He thanked the PCW for its phenomenal efforts to set a stringent standard for gender mainstreaming and assured that the CFO would participate in PCW’s efforts to promote gender and development perspectives and build competencies of government officials and responsive gender-restraining strategies.</p>

                    Ms. Balmes discussed basic GAD Concepts, gender bias and its manifestations, social institutions that potentially perpetuate gender issues and biases, and the importance for government agencies to take on the gender lens perspective in the fulfillment of its mandate. She emphasized that gender is an important factor to consider in development as it is concerned with how social norms and power structures influence the availability of and access to opportunities for different groups of men and women.</p>

                    Atty.

The recommendations were formulated based on the results of the preparatory meeting with the CFO staff and on the results of the GADtimpala validation. Some of Ms. Nharleen’s recommendations were incorporating GAD core messages in the training modules used for the pre-departure orientations, and counseling sessions, integrating the gender perspective in CFO’s Vision statement, conducting GAD capacity-building activities for the GFPS, and developing an Agency GAD Agenda.<br><br>

                    Overall, the recommended action points have allowed the Commission to clearly identify the concrete areas it has to address to attain the standards of the highest level of the Gender Mainstreaming Evaluation Framework.</p>

Alma Royandoyan-Alli, Chair of the CFO-GFPS Execom pointed out that as one of the migration-related government agencies, the CFO strongly recognizes that there is more to the context of gender dynamics than just looking at the differences between migration flows between males and females. She added that the CFO has already acknowledged that inequalities among the CFO’s clientele exist, and addressing these inequalities is imperative to the determination of instituting policies and programs that are relevant and responsive to existing gender-related disparities.<br><br>

                    She brought the executive briefing to a close by thanking the PCW for its insights and recommendations and added that these strengthen the CFO’s resolve to surpass the accomplishments it has attained in recent years.
